# Piper TTS UI for English Learners

## What is this?

This is a simple project that provides:

âœ… Text-to-Speech (TTS) for English learners  
âœ… IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) view to improve pronunciation

It runs locally on your computer and only requires a CPU.  
No need for a high-spec GPU or paid APIs like OpenAI TTS.
- Text-to-Speech uses [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)
- IPA transcription uses [Phonemizer](https://github.com/bootphon/phonemizer)

This project is free and open source, so anyone can use it!
